# KMeans University Clustering

## Project Overview
This project aims to cluster universities into two groups: Private and Public, using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The dataset includes various features such as the number of applications received, enrollment rates, tuition costs, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 777 observations on the following 18 variables:
- **Private**: Indicates if the university is private or public.
- **Apps**: Number of applications received.
- **Accept**: Number of applications accepted.
- **Enroll**: Number of new students enrolled.
- **Top10perc**: Percentage of new students from the top 10% of their high school class.
- **Top25perc**: Percentage of new students from the top 25% of their high school class.
- **F.Undergrad**: Number of full-time undergraduates.
- **P.Undergrad**: Number of part-time undergraduates.
- **Outstate**: Out-of-state tuition.
- **Room.Board**: Room and board costs.
- **Books**: Estimated book costs.
- **Personal**: Estimated personal spending.
- **PhD**: Percentage of faculty with Ph.D.s.
- **Terminal**: Percentage of faculty with terminal degrees.
- **S.F.Ratio**: Student/faculty ratio.
- **perc.alumni**: Percentage of alumni who donate.
- **Expend**: Instructional expenditure per student.
- **Grad.Rate**: Graduation rate.
